# PARCEL DELIVERY SYSTEM (BACKEND)

#### The **Parcel Delivery System** is a full-stack web application designed to manage the lifecycle of parcel delivery ‚Äî from booking to final delivery. This system is a secure, modular and supports multiple user roles (Admin, Sender, Receiver) and offers features such as real-time tracking, status updates, and role-based access control.

## Core Features

- **üîê Secure Authentication**: Implements a JWT (JSON Web Token) based system for secure user login and session management, with password hashing using bcrypt.

- **üé≠ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Features three distinct user roles‚Äî ==Admin==, ==Sender==, and ==Receiver== ‚Äîeach with a specific set of permissions to ensure data integrity and security.

- **üì¶ Complete Parcel Lifecycle Management:**: Senders can create, manage, cancel, and Receivers can receive parcels. The system handles all status transitions logically.

- **üîç Real-Time Tracking System:**: Every parcel is assigned a unique, trackable ID. The embedded status history allows users to monitor the parcel's journey from origin to destination

- **‚öôÔ∏è Admin Oversight:**: A powerful Admin role with the ability to view and manage all users and parcels, update delivery statuses, and ensure the smooth operation of the system.
